    <section class="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I am a dedicated Cloud and DevOps Engineer with a strong background in AWS and infrastructure automation. With a passion for transforming cloud operations, I've spent the last few years honing my skills in cloud architecture, containerization, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

            During my tenure as a Senior AWS Instructor at Magic Bus, I played a pivotal role in shaping the cloud careers of over 100 learners, guiding them through the complexities of AWS and helping them achieve their AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. My experience with the AWS re/Start program has not only solidified my expertise in AWS but also instilled in me a commitment to fostering the next generation of cloud professionals.
            
            At Capgemini, as a DevOps Engineer L2, I was at the forefront of cloud operations, ensuring that our infrastructure was not only robust but also cost-efficient. I led initiatives that automated infrastructure deployment using Terraform, resulting in a significant reduction in operational costs. My hands-on experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD tools like Jenkins and CodePipeline has enabled me to drive efficiency and reliability in our cloud environments. Collaborating with teams at Discover Financial Services, I ensured that cloud solutions were seamlessly integrated into their workflows, meeting the high standards expected of a global financial leader.
            
            Certified in AWS Cloud Practitioner, AWS Solutions Architect Associate, AWS re/Start Accredited Instructor, and HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate, I bring a blend of practical knowledge and certification-backed expertise. My commitment to continuous learning and improvement drives me to stay at the cutting edge of cloud technology, ensuring that I deliver solutions that are not only effective but also forward-looking.
            
            Whether it's guiding a team through complex cloud challenges or automating infrastructure to optimize performance, I am passionate about leveraging technology to create scalable, resilient, and cost-effective solutions. My journey in the cloud and DevOps space is driven by a desire to innovate and lead, ensuring that businesses can harness the full potential of the cloud.
